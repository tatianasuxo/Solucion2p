1. download and install MsMPI & MsMPI SDK (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb524831(v=vs.85).aspx)
from here (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52981)

2. Install both

3. Download boost 1.63.0 from here (https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/?source=typ_redirect) (MUST BE 1_63)
4. unzip boost_1_63_0 folder into 3DESCA main dir
5. launch bootstrap.bat
6. create file user-config.jam with line "using mpi ;" (without quotes) in the user folder (e.x. C:\Users\myUser\user-config.jam)
7. If your MPI installation directories are different, go to boost_1_63_0/tools/build/src/tools/mpi.jam and change lines below line 248

"""
    # Paths for Microsoft MPI
    local ms_mpi_path_native = "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft MPI" ;
    local ms_mpi_sdk_path_native = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\MPI" ;
"""

8. go to boost_1_63_0, open cmd and run:
bjam.exe --with-mpi --with-serialization --toolchain=msvc-11.0 address-model=64
9. After all these steps, x64 version should be buildable. If You want to run x86 version, just remove 'address-model=64' from the command and rerun it

10. to run mpi based application run the following in cmd:
mpiexec -n 2 3DESCA.exe
